# ML_AAC_DISEASEPREDICTION

Problem Statement:

- Prediction of diseases based on symptoms(In order to improve medical attention given to patients)

ABSTRACT:

- Disease Prediction using Machine Learning is the system that is used to predict the diseases from the symptoms which are given by the patients or any user. The system processes the symptoms provided by the user as input and gives the output as the probability of the disease. Decision tree algorithm is used in the prediction of the disease which is a supervised machine learning algorithm. The probability of the disease is calculated by the Decision tree  algorithm. With an increase in biomedical and healthcare data, accurate analysis of medical data benefits early disease detection and patient care. By using linear regression and decision tree we are predicting diseases like Diabetes, Malaria, Jaundice, Dengue, and Tuberculosis.
 
        Decision tree is a structure that can be used to divide up a large collection of records into successfully smaller sets of records by applying a sequence of simple decision tree. With each successive division, the members of the resulting sets become more and more similar to each other. A decision tree model consists of a set of rules for dividing a large heterogeneous population into smaller, more homogeneous (mutually exclusive) groups with respect to a particular target. The target variable is usually categorical and the decision tree is used either to:  Calculate the probability that a given record belong to each of the category and,  To classify the record by assigning it to the most likely class (or category). In this disease prediction system, decision tree divides the symptoms as per its category and reduces the dataset difficulty
